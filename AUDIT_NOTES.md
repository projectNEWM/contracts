# Best Practices

4. I can not find any examples of value lifting for PlutusV2 at the time of audit. If an example is found then hardcoded values will be replaced with lifted values.

6. A) isNInputs will stay the same for now.

7. Code Refactor will occur after best practice 8.

8. Min/Max of script will occur after audit completion.
