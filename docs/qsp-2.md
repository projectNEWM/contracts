# QSP-2 Risk of Starter Token Duplicates and Tokenized Token Name Clashing

Creating a Starter Token should be a rare occurrence requires multisig signers so each catalog created has a unique name. The plan is to only ever have a single NEWM catalog. The catalog feature was created out of an abundance of caution in the event we needed to separate things for legal or other unforseen reasons. Since the contracts are open-source, it's possible that others might wish to create a catalog with the same name as NEWM. In this unlikely event, they would have different signatures in the multi-sig and thus all tokens would be generated with different policy ids. The risk here would be similar to standard NFT project copycats where they mint copy NFTs with the same image data and a different policy id.
