# Management of the Batcher Certificates

Batcher certificates play a pivotal role in the initial sale transaction system, serving as a requisite token within the reference data that a UTxO must possess for a transaction to be considered valid. These certificates are central to the operational framework, acting as a mechanism for decentralizing the batcher system. 

## Certificate as a Decentralization Lever

The design of the batcher certificate system is inherently flexible, allowing for various levels of decentralization. By designating the batcher certificate as a specific token type, control over the batcher system can be finely tuned. For instance, if the certificate is an NFT (Non-Fungible Token), the system can be controlled by a single entity or a select few, creating a more centralized structure. Conversely, setting the certificate requirement to something as common as a single lovelace would open participation to a broader audience, promoting a more decentralized approach. NEWM's strategy aims to balance scarcity, utility, and security within the batcher system by leveraging NFTs, thereby enhancing both the value and functionality of the certificates.

## Functionality and Accessibility

Ownership of a batcher certificate grants the holder the authority to fulfill orders from the queue. It's important to note that while a batcher may possess multiple certificates, a single certificate is sufficient to participate in order fulfillment. This aspect of the design underscores the flexibility and inclusivity of the system, allowing participants to engage in various capacities.

## Tradable Certificates

Batcher certificates are designed to be tradable assets, not restricted to any particular wallet. This trading capability ensures that certificates can circulate within the ecosystem, enhancing liquidity and enabling participants to transfer their fulfillment rights. This feature not only adds a layer of dynamism to the batcher system but also fosters an active market for certificates, encouraging participation and investment in the infrastructure.

In summary, the management of batcher certificates is a critical component of the initial sale system, providing a scalable and adaptable framework for decentralization, participation, and market activity.
